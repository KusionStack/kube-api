                            must be specified.


                            The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
                            the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external
                            DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
                            in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
                            also be an IP address.


                            Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is
                            risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
                            which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
                            webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                            to turn up in a new cluster.


                            The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".


                            A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                            a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                            webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.
